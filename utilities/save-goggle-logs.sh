# The goggles keep the current boot as HDZGOGGLE.log and the finished ones in
# boot-logs/, numbered upwards, up to 999 of them. That is a lot of room to
# notice something and go and get the card, but it is still a window: the
# oldest falls off, and this is what takes things out of the queue.
#
# Every candidate is read to be checksummed, so importing a card holding
# hundreds of logs takes a moment. Ones already in the archive are then
# skipped, so it is only ever slow, never wasteful.
#
# A log already in the archive is recognised by its checksum and skipped, so
# running this on the same card twice costs nothing, and running it every time
# the card is in the machine is the point -- the boot worth keeping is always
# identified after the fact.
#
# Names are <archive date>-[label-]boot<total>ms-<checksum>.log.gz. The date is
# this machine's: the goggles have no RTC battery and restore the same fake
# time every boot, so their own timestamps sort nothing. The boot total is read
# out of the log, so the boot that took ten seconds can be found by name.
